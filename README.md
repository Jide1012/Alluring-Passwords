# Password Generator Starter Code

I did this project because as an employee with access to sensitive data
I waned to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
to create a strong password that provides greater security. When I click the generate password button I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. The password but have between 8 to 128 characters and I must whether I want to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. When I answer each prompt, a password will be generated that matches the selected criteria. 

Installation: The first step I did for the script.js is generate the array of Characters. So I created varibles for upperCaseLetters,lowerCaseLetters, specialChars, and numbers.

Step 2: Added varible confirmation of the upperCaseLetters,lowerCaseLetters, specialChars, and numbers to see the password criteria the user wants. Then add the prompt of how many characters the user wants in their password.
