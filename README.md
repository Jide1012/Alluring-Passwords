# Password Generator Starter Code

I did this project because as an employee with access to sensitive data
I waned to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
to create a strong password that provides greater security. When I click the generate password button I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. The password but have between 8 to 128 characters and I must whether I want to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. When I answer each prompt, a password will be generated that matches the selected criteria. 

Installation: After setting up the HTML and CSS I first did the script.js is generate the array of Characters. So I created varibles for upperCaseLetters,lowerCaseLetters, specialChars, and numbers.

Step 2: I then created a global variable of password info, arrays, and reset password so after the password is generated it will reset.

Step 3: After that I added if statements to get my final character arrays to see if I wanted to include Lower, Upper,Special, Number to combine Character Array.

Step 4: Then I added Generator functions so when I click the event listener Generate Password it will run the init function which prompted me to ask all the questions for the password criteria and the Math Random function to generate a random password.

Step 5: After this it returns the password.info array which develops the variable password which helps this password show on the screen.
